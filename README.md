# Smoke Simulation System

A hobby smoke simulation system implemented using C++ and CUDA for GPU acceleration (educational purpose only).

## Features

- Real-time smoke simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations
- CUDA-accelerated computation for high-performance processing
- Customizable simulation parameters (viscosity, diffusion rate, etc.)
- Support for exporting simulation frames (OpenVDB)

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Compute Capability 8.0 or higher recommended)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.0 or newer
- C++20 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.24 or newer
